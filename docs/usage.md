# Usage

(sec_usage_toy_example)=

## Toy example

_Tsinfer_ takes as input a [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/) file, with phased variant data encoded in the
[VCF Zarr](https://github.com/sgkit-dev/vcf-zarr-spec/) (.vcz) format. The standard
route to create such a file is by conversion from a VCF file, e.g. using
[vcf2zarr](https://sgkit-dev.github.io/bio2zarr/vcf2zarr/overview.html) as described later in this
document. However, for the moment we'll just use a pre-generated dataset:


```{code-cell} ipython3
import zarr
ds = zarr.load("_static/example_data.vcz")
```

This is what the genotypes stored in that datafile look like:

```{code-cell}
:"tags": ["remove-input"]
import numpy as np
assert all(len(np.unique(a)) == len(a) for a in ds['variant_allele']) 
assert any([np.sum(g) == 1 for g in ds['call_genotype']]) # at least one singleton
assert any([np.sum(g) == 0 for g in ds['call_genotype']]) # at least one non-variable

alleles = ds['variant_allele'].astype(str)
sites = np.arange(ds['call_genotype'].shape[0])
print(" " * 22, "Site:", " ".join(str(x) for x in range(8)), "\n")
for sample in range(ds['call_genotype'].shape[1]):
    for genome in range(ds['call_genotype'].shape[2]):
        genotypes = ds['call_genotype'][:,sample, genome]
        print(
            f"Diploid sample {sample} (genome {genome}):",
            " ".join(alleles[sites, genotypes])
        )
```

### VariantData and ancestral alleles

We wish to infer a genealogy that could have given rise to this data set. To run _tsinfer_
we wrap the .vcz file in a `tsinfer.VariantData` object. This requires an 
*ancestral allele* to be specified for each site; there are
many methods for calculating these: details are outside the scope of this manual, but we
have started a [discussion topic](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tsinfer/discussions/523)
on this issue to provide some recommendations.

Sometimes VCF files will contain the
ancestral allele in the "AA" info field, in which case it will be encoded in the
`variant_AA` field of the .vcz file. It's also possible to provide a numpy array
of ancestral alleles, of the same length as the number of variants. Ancestral
alleles that are not in the list of alleles for their respective site are treated as unknown
and not used for inference (with a warning given).

```{code-cell}
import tsinfer

# For this example take the REF allele (index 0) as ancestral
ancestral_alleles = ds['variant_allele'][:,0].astype(str)
# This is just a numpy array, set the last site to an unknown value, for demo purposes
ancestral_alleles[-1] = "."

vdata = tsinfer.VariantData("_static/example_data.vcz", ancestral_alleles)
```

The `VariantData` object is a lightweight wrapper around the .vcz file.
We'll use it to infer a tree sequence on the basis of the sites that vary between the
different samples. However, note that certain sites are not used by _tsinfer_ for inferring
the genealogy (although they are still encoded in the final tree sequence), These are:

* Non-variable (fixed) sites, e.g. site 4 above
* Singleton sites, where only one genome has the derived allele e.g. site 5 above
* Sites where the ancestral allele is unknown, e.g. demonstrated by site 7 above
* Multialleleic sites, with more than 2 alleles (but see
  [here](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tsinfer/issues/670) for a workaround)

Additionally, during the inference step, additional sites can be flagged as not for use in
inference, for example if they are deemed unreliable (this is done
via the `exclude_positions` parameter).

### Masks

Sites which are not used for inference will still be included in the final tree sequence, with
mutations at those sites being placed onto branches by parsimony. However, it is also possible
to completely exclude sites and samples from the final tree sequence, by specifing a `site_mask`
and/or a `sample_mask` when creating the `VariantData` object. Such sites or samples will be
completely omitted from both inference and the final tree sequence. This can be useful, for
example, to reduce the amount of computation required for an inference.

### Topology inference

Once we have stored our data in a `.VariantData` object, we can easily infer 
a {ref}`tree sequence<sec_python_api_trees_and_tree_sequences>` using the Python
API. Note that each sample in the original .vcz file will correspond to an *individual*
in the resulting tree sequence. Since these three individuals are diploid, the resulting
tree sequence will have `ts.num_samples == 6` (i.e. unlike in a .vcz file, a "sample" in
tskit refers to a haploid genome, not a diploid individual).

```{code-cell} ipython3
inferred_ts = tsinfer.infer(vdata)
print("Inferred a genetic genealogy for {inferred_ts.num_samples} (haploid) genomes")
```

And that's it: we now have a fully functional {class}`tskit.TreeSequence`
object that we can interrogate in the usual ways. For example, we can look
at the {meth}`aligned haplotypes<tskit.TreeSequence.alignments>` in the tree sequence:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("Sample\tInferred sequence")
for sample_id, seq in zip(
    inferred_ts.samples(),
    inferred_ts.alignments(missing_data_character="."),
):
    print(sample_id, seq, sep="\t")
```

You will notice that the sample sequences generated by this tree sequence are identical
to the input haplotype data: apart from the imputation of
{ref}`missing data<sec_inference_data_requirements>`, _tsinfer_ is guaranteed to
losslessly encode any given input data, regardless of the inferred topology. You can
check this programatically if you want:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
for v_orig, v_inferred in zip(vdata.variants(), inferred_ts.variants()):
    if any(
        np.array(v_orig.alleles)[v_orig.genotypes] !=
        np.array(v_inferred.alleles)[v_inferred.genotypes]
    ):
        raise ValueError("Genotypes in original dataset and inferred tree seq not equal")
print("** Genotypes in original dataset and inferred tree sequence are the same **")
```

We can examine the inferred genetic genealogy,
in the form of {ref}`local trees<tutorials:sec_what_is_local_trees>`. _Tsinfer_ has also
placed mutations on the genealogy to explain the observed genetic variation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
mut_labels = {
    m.id: "{:g}: {}→{}".format(
        s.position,
        inferred_ts.mutation(m.parent).derived_state if m.parent >= 0 else s.ancestral_state,
        m.derived_state,
    )
    for s in inferred_ts.sites()
    for m in s.mutations
}
node_labels = {u: u for u in inferred_ts.samples()}

inferred_ts.draw_svg(
    size=(500, 200), node_labels=node_labels, mutation_labels=mut_labels, y_axis=True)
```

We have inferred 4 trees aong the genome. Note, however, that there are "polytomies" in the
trees, where some nodes have more than two children (e.g. the root node in the first tree).
This is a common feature of trees inferred by _tsinfer_ and signals that there was not
sufficient information to resolve the tree at this internal node.


Each internal (non-sample) node in this inferred tree represents an ancestral sequence,
constructed on the basis of shared, derived alleles at one or more of the sites. By
default, the time of each such node is *not* measured in years or generations, but
is simply the frequency of the shared derived allele(s) on which the ancestral sequence
is based. For this reason, the time units are described as "uncalibrated" in the plot,
and trying to calculate statistics based on branch lengths will raise an error:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["raises-exception"]
inferred_ts.diversity(mode="branch")
```

To add meaningful dates to an inferred tree sequence, allowing meaningful branch length
statistics to be calulated, you must use additional
software such as [tsdate](https://tskit.dev/software/tsdate.html): the _tsinfer_
algorithm is only intended to infer the genetic relationships between the samples
(i.e. the *topology* of the tree sequence).


(sec_usage_simulation_example)=

## Simulation example

The previous example showed how we can infer a tree sequence using the Python API for a trivial
toy example. However, for real data we will not prepare our data and infer the tree sequence all
in one go; rather, we will usually split the process into at least two distinct steps.

The first step in any inference is to prepare your data and create the .vcz file.
For simplicity here we'll use
Python to simulate some data under the coalescent with recombination, using
[msprime](https://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#msprime.simulate):

```{code-cell} ipython3

import builtins
import sys
import os
import subprocess

from Bio import bgzf
import numpy as np

import msprime
import tsinfer

if getattr(builtins, "__IPYTHON__", False):  # if running IPython: e.g. in a notebook
    num_diploids, seq_len = 100, 10_000
    name = "notebook-simulation"
    python = sys.executable
else:  # Take parameters from the command-line
    num_diploids, seq_len = int(sys.argv[1]), float(sys.argv[2])
    name = "cli-simulation"
    python = "python"

ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(
    num_diploids,
    population_size=10**4,
    recombination_rate=1e-8,
    sequence_length=seq_len,
    random_seed=6,
)
ts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1e-8, random_seed=7)
ts.dump(name + "-source.trees")
print(
    f"Simulated {ts.num_samples} samples over {seq_len/1e6} Mb:",
    f"{ts.num_trees} trees and {ts.num_sites} sites"
)

# Convert to a zarr file: this should be easier once a tskit2zarr utility is made, see
# https://github.com/sgkit-dev/bio2zarr/issues/232
np.save(f"{name}-AA.npy", [s.ancestral_state for s in ts.sites()])
vcf_name = f"{name}.vcf.gz"
with bgzf.open(vcf_name, "wt") as f:
    ts.write_vcf(f)
subprocess.run(["tabix", vcf_name])
ret = subprocess.run(
    [python, "-m", "bio2zarr", "vcf2zarr", "convert", "--force", vcf_name, f"{name}.vcz"],
    stderr = subprocess.DEVNULL if name == "notebook-simulation" else None,
)
assert os.path.exists(f"{name}.vcz")

if ret.returncode == 0:
    print(f"Converted to {name}.vcz")
```

Here we first run a simulation then we create a vcf file and convert it to .vcz format.
If we store this code in a file named `simulate-data.py`, we can run it on the
command line, providing parameters to generate much bigger datasets:


```{code} bash
% python simulate-data.py 5000 10_000_000
Simulated 10000 samples over 10.0 Mb: 36204 trees and 38988 sites
    Scan: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 1.00/1.00 [00:00<00:00, 2.86files/s]
 Explode: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 39.0k/39.0k [01:17<00:00, 501vars/s]
  Encode: 100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 976M/976M [00:12<00:00, 78.0MB/s]
Finalise: 100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 10.0/10.0 [00:00<00:00, 421array/s]
```

Here, we simulated a sample of 10 thousand chromosomes, each 10Mb long, under
human-like parameters. That has created 39K segregating sites. The output
above shows the state of the vcf-to-zarr conversion at the end of this process,
indicating that it took about a minute to convert the data into .vcz format
(this only needs doing once)

Examining the files on the command line, we then see the following::

```{code} bash
$ du -sh cli-simulation*
156K	cli-simulation-AA.npy
8.8M	cli-simulation-source.trees
 25M	cli-simulation.vcf.gz
8.0K	cli-simulation.vcf.gz.tbi
9.4M	cli-simulation.vcz
```

The `cli-simulation.vcz` zarr data is quite small, about the same size as the
original `msprime` tree sequence file. Since (like all zarr datastores)
 `cli-simulation.vcz` is a directory
we can peer inside to look where everything is stored:

```{code} bash
$ du -sh cli-simulation.vcz/*
8.7M	cli-simulation.vcz/call_genotype
 88K	cli-simulation.vcz/call_genotype_mask
 88K	cli-simulation.vcz/call_genotype_phased
 12K	cli-simulation.vcz/contig_id
 12K	cli-simulation.vcz/contig_length
 12K	cli-simulation.vcz/filter_id
 28K	cli-simulation.vcz/sample_id
 52K	cli-simulation.vcz/variant_allele
 24K	cli-simulation.vcz/variant_contig
 24K	cli-simulation.vcz/variant_filter
 48K	cli-simulation.vcz/variant_id
 24K	cli-simulation.vcz/variant_id_mask
144K	cli-simulation.vcz/variant_position
 24K	cli-simulation.vcz/variant_quality
```

Most of this output is not particularly interesting here, but we can see that the
`call_genotype` array which holds all of the sample genotypes (and thus the vast bulk of the
actual data) only requires about 8.7MB compared to 25MB for the compressed vcf file.
In practice this means we can keep such files lying around without taking up too much space.

Once we have our `.vcz` file created, running the inference is straightforward.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Infer & save a ts from the notebook simulation.
ancestral_alleles = np.load(f"{name}-AA.npy")
vdata = tsinfer.VariantData(f"{name}.vcz", ancestral_alleles)
tsinfer.infer(vdata, progress_monitor=True, num_threads=4).dump(name + ".trees")
```

Running the `infer` command runs the full inference pipeline in one go (the individual steps
are explained {ref}`here <sec_inference>`). We provided two extra arguments to `infer`:
`progress_monitor` gives us the progress bars show above, and `num_threads=4` tells
_tsinfer_ to use four worker threads whenever it can use them.

Performing this inference on the `cli-simulation` data using Core i5 processor (launched 2009)
with 4GiB of RAM, took about eighteen minutes. The maximum memory usage was about 600MiB.

The output files look like this:

```{code} bash
$ ls -lh cli-simulation*
-rw-r--r--  1 user  group   8.2M 14 Oct 13:45 cli-simulation-source.trees
-rw-r--r--  1 user  group    22M 14 Oct 13:45 cli-simulation.samples
-rw-r--r--  1 user  group   8.1M 14 Oct 13:50 cli-simulation.trees
```

Therefore our output tree sequence file that we have just inferred in a few minutes is
*even smaller* than the original ``msprime`` simulated tree sequence!
Because the output file is also a {class}`tskit.TreeSequence`, we can use the same API
to work with both. For example, to load up the original and inferred tree sequences
from their corresponding `.trees` files you can simply use the {func}`tskit.load`
function, as shown below.

However, there are thousands of trees in these tree sequences, each of which has
10 thousand samples: much too much to easily visualise. Therefore, in the code below, we
we subset both tree sequences down to their minimal representations for the first six
sample nodes using {meth}`tskit.TreeSequence.simplify`, while keeping all sites, even if
they do not show genetic variation between the six selected samples.
:::{note}
Using this tiny subset of the overall data allows us to get an informal
feel for the trees that are inferred by _tsinfer_, but this is certainly
not a recommended approach for validating the inference!
:::

Once we've subsetted the tree sequences down to something that we can comfortably look
at, we can plot the trees in particular regions of interest, for example the first
2kb of genome. Below, for simplicity we use the smaller dataset that was simulated and
inferred within the the notebook, but exactly the same code will work with
the larger version run from the cli simulation.  


```{code-cell} ipython3
import tskit

subset = range(0, 6)  # show first 6 samples
limit = (0, 2_000)    # show only the trees covering the first 2kb

prefix = "notebook"  # Or use "cli" for the larger example
source = tskit.load(prefix + "-simulation-source.trees")
source_subset = source.simplify(subset, filter_sites=False)
print(f"True tree seq, simplified to {len(subset)} sampled genomes")
source_subset.draw_svg(size=(800, 200), x_lim=limit, time_scale="rank")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
inferred = tskit.load(prefix + "-simulation.trees")
inferred_subset = inferred.simplify(subset, filter_sites=False)
print(f"Inferred tree seq, simplified to {len(subset)} sampled genomes")
inferred_subset.draw_svg(size=(800, 200), x_lim=limit)
```

There are a number of things to note when comparing the plots above. Most
obviously, the first tree in the inferred tree sequence is empty: by default, _tsinfer_
will not generate a genealogy before the first site in the genome (here, position 655)
or past the last site, as there is, by definition, no data in these regions.

You can also see that the inferred tree sequence has fewer trees than the original,
simulated one. There are two reasons for this. First, there are some tree changes that
do not involve a change of topology (e.g. the first two trees in the original tree
sequence are topologically identical, as are two trees after that).
Even if we had different mutations on the
different edges in these trees, such tree changes are unlikely to be spotted.
Second, our inference depends on the mutational information that is present. If no
mutations fall on a particular edge in the tree sequence, then we have no way of
inferring that this edge existed. The fact that there are no mutations in the first,
third, and fifth trees shows that tree changes can occur without associated mutations.
As a result, there will be tree transitions that we cannot pick up. In the simulation
that we performed, the mutation rate is equal to the recombination rate, and so we
expect that many recombinations will be invisible to us.

For similar reasons, there will be many nodes in the tree at which
polytomies occur. Here we correctly infer that sample nodes 0 and 4 group together,
as do 1 and 2. However, in the middle inferred tree we were not able to distinguish
whether node 3 was closer to node 1 or 2, so we have three children of node 7 in that
tree.

Finally, you should note that inference does not always get the right answer. At the
first site in the inferred trees, node 5 is placed as an outgroup, but at this site
it is actually closer to the group consisting of nodes 0 and 4.

:::{note}
Other than the sample node IDs, it is meaningless to compare node numbers in the
source and inferred tree sequences.

## Data example

Inputting real data for inference is similar in principle to the examples above.
All that is required is a .vcz file, which can be created using
[vcf2zarr](https://sgkit-dev.github.io/bio2zarr/vcf2zarr/overview.html) as above

(sec_usage_read_vcf)=

### Reading a VCF

For example data, we use a publicly available VCF file of the genetic
variants from chromosome 24 of ten Norwegian and French house sparrows,
*Passer domesticus* (thanks to Mark Ravinet for the data file):

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["remove-output"]
import zarr

vcf_location = "_static/P_dom_chr24_phased.vcf.gz"
!python -m bio2zarr vcf2zarr convert --force {vcf_location} sparrows.vcz
```

This creates the `sparrows.vcz` datastore, which we open using `tsinfer.VariantData`.
The original VCF had ancestral alleles specified in the `AA` INFO field, so we can
simply provide the string `"variant_AA"` as the ancestral_allele parameter.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Do the inference: this VCF has ancestral alleles in the AA field
vdata = tsinfer.VariantData("sparrows.vcz", ancestral_allele="variant_AA")
ts = tsinfer.infer(vdata)
print(
    "Inferred tree sequence: {} trees over {} Mb ({} edges)".format(
        ts.num_trees, ts.sequence_length / 1e6, ts.num_edges
    )
)
```

On a modern computer, this should only take a few seconds to run.

### Adding more metadata

We can add additional data to the zarr file, which will make it through to the tree sequence.
For instance, we might want to mark which population each individual comes from.
This can be done by adding some descriptive metadata for each population, and the assigning
each sample to one of those populations. In our case, the sample sparrow IDs beginning with
"FR" are from France:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import json
import numpy as np
import tskit
import zarr

ds = zarr.load("sparrows.vcz")

populations = ("Norway", "France")
# save the population data in json format
schema = json.dumps(tskit.MetadataSchema.permissive_json().schema).encode()
zarr.save("sparrows.vcz/populations_metadata_schema", schema)
metadata = [
    json.dumps({"name": pop, "description": "The country from which this sample comes"}).encode()
    for pop in populations
]
zarr.save("sparrows.vcz/populations_metadata", metadata)

# Now assign each diploid sample to a population
num_individuals = ds["sample_id"].shape[0]
individuals_population = np.full(num_individuals, tskit.NULL, dtype=np.int32)
for i, name in enumerate(ds["sample_id"]):
    if name.startswith("FR"):
        individuals_population[i] = populations.index("France")
    else:
        individuals_population[i] = populations.index("Norway")
zarr.save("sparrows.vcz/individuals_population", individuals_population)
```

Now when we carry out the inference, we get a tree sequence in which the nodes are
correctly assigned to named populations

```{code-cell} ipython3
vdata = tsinfer.VariantData("sparrows.vcz", ancestral_allele="variant_AA")
sparrow_ts = tsinfer.infer(vdata)

for sample_node_id in sparrow_ts.samples():
    individual_id = sparrow_ts.node(sample_node_id).individual
    population_id = sparrow_ts.node(sample_node_id).population
    print(
        "Node",
        sample_node_id,
        "labels a chr24 sampled from individual",
        sparrow_ts.individual(individual_id).metadata["variant_data_sample_id"],
        "in",
        sparrow_ts.population(population_id).metadata["name"],
    )
```

### Analysis

To analyse your inferred tree sequence you can use all the analysis functions built in to
the [tskit](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/) library. The
{ref}`tskit tutorial<sec_tutorial_stats>` provides much more detail. Below we just give a
flavour of the possibilities.

To quickly eyeball small datasets, we can draw the entire tree sequence, or
{meth}`~tskit.Tree.draw` the tree at any particular genomic position. The following
code demonstrates how to use the {meth}`tskit.TreeSequence.at` method to obtain the tree
1Mb from the start of the sequence, and plot it, colouring the tips according to
population:

```{code-cell} ipython3
colours = {"Norway": "red", "France": "blue"}
colours_for_node = {}
for n in sparrow_ts.samples():
    population_data = sparrow_ts.population(sparrow_ts.node(n).population)
    colours_for_node[n] = colours[population_data.metadata["name"]]

individual_for_node = {}
for n in sparrow_ts.samples():
    individual_data = sparrow_ts.individual(sparrow_ts.node(n).individual)
    individual_for_node[n] = individual_data.metadata["variant_data_sample_id"]

tree = sparrow_ts.at(1e6)
tree.draw(
    path="tree_at_1Mb.svg",
    height=700,
    width=1200,
    node_labels=individual_for_node,
    node_colours=colours_for_node,
)
```

This tree seems to suggest that Norwegian and French individuals may not fall into
discrete groups on the tree, but be part of a larger mixing population. Note, however,
that this is only one of thousands of trees, and may not be typical of the genome as a
whole. Additionally, most data sets will have far more samples than this example, so
trees visualized in this way are likely to be huge and difficult to understand. As in
the {ref}`simulation example <sec_usage_simulation_example>` above, one possibility
is to {meth}`~tskit.TreeSequence.simplify` the tree sequence to a limited number of
samples, but it is likely that most studies will
instead rely on various statistical summaries of the trees. Storing genetic data as a
tree sequence makes many of these calculations fast and efficient, and tskit has both a
set of {ref}`commonly used methods<sec_stats>` and a framework that
{ref}`generalizes population genetic statistics<sec_stats_general_api>`. For example,
the allele or site frequency spectrum (SFS) can be calculated using
{meth}`tskit.TreeSequence.allele_frequency_spectrum` and the allelic diversity ("Tajima's
{math}`{\pi}`") using {meth}`tskit.TreeSequence.diversity`, both of which can also be
calculated locally (e.g. {ref}`per tree or in genomic windows <sec_stats_windows>`). As
a basic example, here's how to calculate genome-wide {math}`F_{st}` between the Norwegian
and French (sub)populations:

```{code-cell} ipython3
samples_listed_by_population = [
    sparrow_ts.samples(population=pop_id)
    for pop_id in range(sparrow_ts.num_populations)
]

print("Fst between populations:", sparrow_ts.Fst(samples_listed_by_population))
```

As noted above, the times of nodes are uncalibrated so we shouldn't perform
calculations that reply on branch lengths. However, some statistics, such as the
genealogical nearest neighbour (GNN) proportions are calculated from the topology
of the trees. Here's an example, using the individual and population metadata to format the results table in
a tidy manner

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd

gnn = sparrow_ts.genealogical_nearest_neighbours(
    sparrow_ts.samples(), samples_listed_by_population
)

# Tabulate GNN nicely using a Pandas dataframe with named rows and columns
sample_nodes = [sparrow_ts.node(n) for n in sparrow_ts.samples()]
sample_ids = [n.id for n in sample_nodes]
sample_names = [
    sparrow_ts.individual(n.individual).metadata["variant_data_sample_id"]
    for n in sample_nodes
]
sample_pops = [
    sparrow_ts.population(n.population).metadata["name"]
    for n in sample_nodes

From this, it can be seen that the genealogical nearest neighbours of birds in Norway
tend also to be in Norway, and vice versa for birds from France. In other words, there is
a small but noticable degree of population structure in the data. The bird ``8L19766``
and one of the chromosomes of bird `FR046` seem to buck this trend, and it would
probably be worth checking these data points further (perhaps they are migrant birds),
and verifying if other chromosomes in these individuals show the same pattern.

Much more can be done with the genomic statistics built into tskit. For further
information, please refer to the {ref}`statistics section<sec_stats>` of the
tskit documentation.
